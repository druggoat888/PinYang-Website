                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>
                    Okonomiyaki is a Japanese teppanyaki, savoury pancake dish consisting of wheat flour batter and other ingredients (mixed, or as toppings) cooked on a teppan (flat griddle).
                    <br>
                    Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with two distinct variants from Hiroshima or the Kansai region of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country, with toppings and batters varying by area.

                </p>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>

                <p>
                    For the pancake base:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pork/Bacon</li>
                        <li>Cabbage</li>
                        <li>Flour</li>
                        <li>Dashi Powder</li>
                        <li>Cornflour</li>
                        <li>Egg</li>
                        <li>Green Onion</li>
                        <li>Corn</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the toppings:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Okonomiyaki Sauce</li>
                        <li>Kewpie Mayonnaise</li>
                        <li>Dried Seaweed Flakes</li>
                        <li>Dried Bonito Flakes</li>
                        <li>Pickled Red Ginger (Optional)</li>
                        <li>Japanese 7 Spice (Optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Directions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fry the bacon until cooked through and crispy, then set aside to cool. No need to use oil here, as the bacon will release its own oil as you cook it.</li>
                    <li>To make the batter, combine the eggs and dashi powder dissolved in the warm water in a small mixing bowl and beat gently. In a separate large mixing bowl add your flour and cornflour, then pour over with the egg and dashi stock mixture. Stir and combine until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Next, add the shredded cabbage, half of the green onion slices, cooked bacon and corn into the batter mixture. Mix until all the dry ingredients are evenly coated (but don’t overmix, we want to keep that cabbage nice and fluffy). There shouldn’t be much excess batter liquid at the bottom – if there is, just add a little more chopped cabbage and mix through gently. </li>
                    <li>Scoop out the mixture onto a large frying pan over medium heat. We like aiming for a circle shape about 10 cm / 4 inches wide. Cook each pancake for a few mins per side, until lightly browned on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Transfer your freshly cooked pancakes to serving plates, then top with drizzles of kewpie mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce. For even better tasting okonomiyaki, top with sprinklings of dried seaweed flakes, bonito flakes and a few slices of green onion to taste. You can also optionally top with the pickled ginger and Japanese 7 spice here.</li>
                </ol>

                    Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish.

                <h4>Directions</h4>
                <ol>
                    Tonkotsu Stock
                    <li>Wash the bones in cold water with clean brush to remove blood. Put the bones in a strainer to drain the excess water.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, add water, bones and kombu. Measure the distance from the top of the pot to the top of the water, make a note of this ‘original water level’.</li>
                    <li>Cook over high heat to bring to a boil and keep boiling. Stir the stock with a long wooden spatula, scrape the bottom to prevent it from burning and to bring the scams to the surface. Skim the scams until they stop appearing.</li>
                    <li>Keep boiling the stock for 4 hours, maintain the ‘original water level’ on (2) by periodically topping up the water so it remains the same. Stir the bottom of the pot to prevent it from burning.</li>
                    <li>When the stock becomes milky and thicker after 4 hours, start reducing the stock. Do not add the water anymore. This is a process of thickening the stock by reduction. Keep boiling the stock until the volume is reduced to about half. During this phase, stirring frequently by scraping the bottom of the pot with the spatula as it can be burnt easily.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat, pour the stock over a strainer to another clean pot. In order to maintain the quality of the stock, it is advisable to cool it rapidly by putting the bottom of the pot into a pool of cold water. Keep the stock in the fridge if stored overnight.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Aroma Oil
                    <li>Cut the pork back fat into small chunks.</li>
                    <li>In a saucepan, add the pork back fat and cook over low heat until melted. It should take about an hour. Take care not to burn the oil.</li>

                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Char Shu Pork
                    <li>Add pork and water in a saucepan, ensure the pork is submerged under the water. Cook over high heat for about 1 hour. If possible, use a meat probe and cook until the core of the pork reaches 70°C.</li>
                    <li>While cooking the pork, prepare a marinade. Add soy sauce, Honteri, sugar, garlic, ginger and chilli in a saucepan.</li>
                    <li>When the pork belly is cooked. Add 400ml of the pork cooking water to the marinade. Heat the marinade over low heat, stir to dissolve sugar. Add the pork belly, cook over low heat for an hour. Keep the pork submerged under the sauce. Alternatively, cook at 70°C in sous vide in a sealed bag.</li>
                    <li>Keep the pork in the marinade in a Ziploc bag, remove air from the bag. Store in the fridge overnight.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Ramen Egg
                    <li>Take out the eggs from the fridge at least 4 hours before cooking to acclimatise the egg.</li>
                    <li>In a saucepan, boil enough water to cover the egg.</li>
                    <li>Cook the eggs for 6.5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cool the eggs immediately under cold running water for 1-2 minutes. Peel the shell straightaway.</li>
                    <li>Pour the leftover Pork Char Shu marinade into a small pot or a clean ziplock bag and add the egg. Remove the air from the bag before sealing. Leave in the fridge for an hour.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
